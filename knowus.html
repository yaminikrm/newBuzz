                    <p class="know-us-paragraph">
                        Led by Mr. Yashwanth Krishna Sanka, a third-generation social entrepreneur, we’re a purpose-driven company focused on delivering value beyond profits. What began in 2014 as a small ticketing kiosk has grown into a trusted name in travel, logistics, financial services, and mobility solutions.
                        In just a few years, we expanded into DTDC shipping, earned IATA accreditation, and launched STK Holidays Pvt. Ltd. to offer premium domestic and international travel experiences — from MICE and FIT to group holidays and travel essentials.
                        By 2019, we entered the Forex market with an RBI license, followed by an IRDA license in 2020 to offer insurance and financial services. Even in tough times, we stayed committed to serving our clients.
                        To make local commuting easier, we launched “Streets Corner” in 2022, offering bike rentals and taxi services in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities — proudly certified by Startup India.
                        With a client-first approach and a passion for innovation, we continue to grow as a one-stop solution for travel, finance, logistics, and mobility — always with a heart for service.
